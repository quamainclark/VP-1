# To Do

- add pagination support in API wrapper.  
  currently blocking: https://bests.glitch.me/smb  
  Continue to enforce some sanity limit like 6 pages (1200 items).

- refactor everything since it's awful
  hey chris is helping with this!

- update data patcher to live in API classes

- update speedrun-patches.js to create normal speedrun.Run objects, and update
  speedrun.Run to patch them in itself, instead of messy with the API response data.

## Ideas?

- embedded video player?

- user pages?
