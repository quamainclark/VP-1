# To Do

- add pagination support in API.

- stop fetching users, just embed them!

- can we also embed levels and categories in the initial 

- decide whether speedrun-patches.js should exist in client or server, then
  move it there properly. right now it's in a least-efficient limbo.

- persistent and timed server-side caching, instead of just random in-memory.
  - slightly less urgent once we're not hammering with excessive requests.
