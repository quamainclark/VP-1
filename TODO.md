# To Do

- # DO THIS fetch levels in parallel with level info, since it doesn't depend on it

- add pagination support in API wrapper.  
  currently blocking: https://bests.glitch.me/smb  
  Continue to enforce some sanity limit like 6 pages (1200 items).

- refactor everything since it's awful

- update data patcher to live in API classes

- decide whether speedrun-patches.js should exist in client or server, then
  move it there properly. right now it's in a least-efficient limbo.

- expand into a multi-view SPA and extract micro-framework as "Bester"
